# GreenAnjou Grant Intelligence Dashboard

## Overview
The GreenAnjou Grant Intelligence Dashboard is a prototype tool for Base Pair Biotechnologies to identify grant opportunities and track active NIH grants. It features tabs for Foundation opportunities (scraped with NLP-based `fit_score`), Grants.gov opportunities (simulated until API key), and NIH RePORTER grants (simulated until API key).

## Features
- **Foundation Tab**: Scrapes foundation websites (e.g., Gates, Wellcome Trust) and matches opportunities to your expertise with a `fit_score`.
- **Grants.gov Tab**: Displays simulated opportunities; will integrate API data once key is received.
- **NIH RePORTER Tab**: Tracks your active grants and calculates success rate; will use API once key is received.
